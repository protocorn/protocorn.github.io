      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) on our servers. However, to provide functionality, the extension may access certain data temporarily within your browser:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Email Content:</strong> The extension fetches email data (e.g., subject, body text, sender, and snippets) to process features such as summarization, reply generation, and keyword highlighting. This data is processed locally within your browser and is not stored, transmitted, or shared with external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Account Information:</strong> When using Gmail-related features, we may access your primary email address and basic account details through Gmail API. This is only used to personalize your experience within the extension.</li>
      </ul>

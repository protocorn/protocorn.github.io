      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information (PII) on our servers. However, to provide functionality, the extension may access certain data temporarily within your browser:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Email Content:</strong> The extension fetches email data (e.g., subject, body text, sender, and snippets) to process features such as summarization, reply generation, and keyword highlighting. This data is processed locally within your browser and is not stored, transmitted, or shared with external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Account Information:</strong> When using Gmail-related features, we may access your primary email address and basic account details through Google’s APIs. This is only used to personalize your experience within the extension.</li>
        <li><strong>API Interactions:</strong> The extension may send anonymized requests to third-party APIs. Only necessary data is transmitted, and no sensitive or personal information is included.</li>
      </ul>
